Hi and welcome to this course.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:06,800
My name is Maximilian Schwartz Miller and I will be your instructor in this course.

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:11,700
Now this course is about typescript superset 2 javascript.

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:17,970
So a programming language which actually builds up on javascript you could say it takes javascript to

5
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:20,420
the next level with typescript.

6
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:26,400
You will see in this course you can write less error prone much better and cleaner code and all use

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,720
some exciting new features which don't exist like this in javascript.

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,650
Now in this course you will learn typescript from scratch.

9
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,200
You don't need to know anything about TIBCO to get started.

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,610
Basic javascript knowledge absolutely suffices.

11
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:47,510
You will learn all the basics of typescript how it works why we use it the different advantages it offers.

12
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,700
We'll dive into the core types it provides and we'll gradually build up knowledge and dive into more

13
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,650
and more advanced typescript features for all at this course.

14
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:04,260
Now this course is both a course that focuses on the theory and showing a broad variety of features

15
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:09,300
as well as showing all these features in action in real projects.

16
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,190
Therefore in this course we'll have a real project.

17
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,470
We'll also have a module where we dive into typescript with react.

18
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:22,800
We'll also have a module where we dive into typescript with node and express sorted by the end of this

19
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,310
course.

20
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:29,700
You really feel comfortable using typescript in your next projects and then you know why you would use

21
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:29,810
it.

22
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:35,490
And most importantly how you would apply it to any javascript project you're working on.

23
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:36,360
No matter.

24
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:42,590
By the way if data is JavaScript in the browser with or without any framework or if it's on the service

25
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,110
side.

26
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,120
So that's all in the course.

27
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:50,430
I'm super excited to start this journey together with you and with that I'd say let's not waste any

28
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:55,340
time and let's find out what exactly types code is and which advantages it has to offer.
